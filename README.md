### Questions and Programming Problems:

#### Basic Programming:

1. Print \"Hello World" [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP01.c)
2. Read a char, int and output the same [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP02.c)
3. Read two integers and output their sum, difference, multiplication [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP03.c)
4. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given the radius [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP04.c)
5. Calculate simple interest given principle, duration and rate of interest [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP05.c)
6. Finding a remainder after dividing one number by another. [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP06.c)
7. Write a program to read a character and output its ASCII value. [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP07.c)
8. Write a program to read a floating point number and output its integer value. [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP08.c)
9. Write a program to read a small character and convert it into capital character. [[Source Code]](https://github.com/codernakul/CP2017/blob/master/Basic-Programming/BP09.c)


#### Conditionals:

1. Write a program that takes as input two integers. For each integer, it should output the whether the given integer is even or odd.
2. Write a ‘C’ program to take as input 3 integer numbers. The program then outputs the largest integer.
3. Write a ‘C’ program to take as input 3 floating point numbers. The program then outputs the number with largest magnitude (Largest magnitude number is the largest number obtained after ignoring the sign)
4. Write a ‘C’ program to take as input 5 integers. The program then outputs all input integers that are larger than the average of the 5 input integers. Assume distinct input integers.
5. Write a program to read an integer input from the user and print the last two digits of that integer.
6. Write a program to read two characters and determine if the first character is capital or small form of the second character
7. Write a program to read an integer and output which of 2, 3, and 5 divide it. There should be only one print statement.
